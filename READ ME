File breakdown:
  > No need to touch app.json, package.json, Procfile, test.js, /view/partials/header.ejs

  > In public/stylesheets/ there is one stylesheet called main.css. That was the one originally
    titled login.css.

  > /pages/ contains each page on our website. Note the .ejs extension. Writing the HTML should be
    no different than the front end team has been doing, just save them as .ejs instead.

  > When adding a new page to the website, add it to index.js. Login and Signup are already in there;
    note the format:
        .get('/signup', (req, res) => res.render('pages/signup'))

          > /signup is what how page will be referenced.
            E.G. in the login html code, the signup page is now referenced like this: <a href="/signup">Sign up</a>

          > pages/signup is the name and location of each file. Do not include '.ejs'
